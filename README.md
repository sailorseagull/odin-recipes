Basic recipe website assignment given by The Odin Project

This was a hands-on introduction to building a basic website structure without styling or JavaScript.
The objective was to practice HTML by creating a website consisting of a main index page, a recipe
directory containing recipe documents, and an image directory containing images corresponding to each
recipe.

The main index page contains an unordered list of links to different recipe webpages. There is a recipe
for how to make granola bars, grilled chicken, and pesto tortellini salad. The recipe list is random and
does not guarantee their compatibility in a single dish, unless that's your thing!

Each webpage is structured with a main heading and three subsequent sections describing the goal
and process for a recipe. The webpage is structured with basic predefined elements consisting of 
heading tags, paragraph tags, anchor tags, ordered and unordered list tags, and image tags built 
upon an HTML boilerplate.
