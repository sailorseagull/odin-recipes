    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
            Grease a 9-inch square baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread oats and coconut evenly across a baking sheet.
            Toast oats and coconut in the preheated oven until browned, about 10 minutes;
            transfer to a large mixing bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix honey, peanut butter, vanilla, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat.
            Cook and stir until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour honey mixture over oats and coconut. Stir to coat. Spread mixture evenly
            into the prepared baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until beginning to dry, about 15 minutes
            for crunchy granola bars, less if you like them chewy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cool completely before cutting and enjoy.
        </li>
    </ol>
